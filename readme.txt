== ABOUT MAGAZINE BASIC 3.0 ==

Magazine Basic is a lightweight HTML5 theme based on the Gridiculous responsive boilerplate. Create a truly unique design with the theme customizer by choosing your own header image, background color or image, page layout, site width, link color and more. Distinguish each post with one of the eight supported post formats: Video, Image, Aside, Status, Audio, Quote, Link and Gallery. Display each of your galleries through a custom jQuery Lightbox style image switcher. Uses Normalize.css for cross browser compatiblity and two Google Fonts for improved typeface readability. Works perfectly in desktop browsers, tablets and handheld devices. For a live demo go to http://demos.bavotasan.com/magazine-basic/.
